# Description
This project presents a simple and scalable deep learning model that gives the cognitive-affective state (i.e., frustrated, confused, bored, neutral, delight) of the student. This was achieved by a combination of the classification model and the pose-estimation model. The custom neural network used to classify the emotion to train the classification model has an accuracy of 86.70% trained on an image dataset containing around 30,000 images. Using live video from the webcam, the combination of the classification model and the pose-estimation model classifies the cognitive-affective state of the student during online learning. This information can generate interventions (e.g., via a chatbot or an intelligent virtual agent) to help the student develop self-regulated learning skills. 
---
•	Identified and classified 5 cognitive-affective states in individuals, including frustration, confusion, boredom, neutrality, and delight. \
•	Deployed a combination of classification and pose-estimation model for accurate analysis. \
•	Presented findings and recommendations in a comprehensive and well-structured research article.
